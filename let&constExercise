const PI=3.14;

// The difference is that with let you can reassign but not redeclare, and with var you can reassign and redeclare. Let creates a block scope

// var you can reassign and redeclare. const you can't reassign nor redeclare. const also creates a block scope

// you can reassign let, you can't do that with const

// hoisting is when using var, you have access to its name and undefined value before it is used
